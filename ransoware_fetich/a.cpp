// this was the leet code version that was patch 
// but recreate a B of Atcoder in dp movement or possibly fft: move of the root
// fact: the cryptographic is protect the strings but no the root so you need the hybrid solution 
//   [root] --> [the easy] just a one 
//   so now  adn root 
//   [A][G][C] thas start to move in recursion that you figuerin out because is ftt crazy


// homework: just look the B of atcoder dp example and attach the string to non-trivial implemntation or this variant of ransoware to erase a replicate data
